Complexity

1. An algorithm that has Big O of 1, O(1), is similar to Star Trek's Enterprise traveling between the stars at Warp speed. An algorithm that has a Big O of 2^n (O(2^n)) is the equivalent of the same Federation starship traveling under Impulse power for intra-solar-system cruising.

2. The best case scenario for Binary Search is that the sought element is the root element of the binary search tree.

3. The worst case scenario for Binary search is that the root element is either the smallest or largest item in the data set, the data set is in fact sorted when the Binary Search Tree was created, and the target element is the opposite extreme of the root (i.e. if the root is smallest item in the collection, the target is the biggest item in the collection, and vice versa). Binary search then is linear search, as it has to check every single element in the collection once before it finds the target.
