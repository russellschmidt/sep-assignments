3. How to make an invitation list for a wedding, excluding destination weddings

3.1 Create a spreadsheet
3.2 List everyone in your life who you would possibly want to hang out with
3.2a List all couples on a single line, if they are a couple
3.2b Ask your respective parents for their guest list, if parents are invited AND you care about their friends and your extended family
3.3 Refer to your budget and location for a maximum capacity. The smaller of the two numbers is your Maximum Head Count. 
3.3a Multiply your Maximum Head count by 1.25. This is your new Maximum Head Count to account for people that cannot make the wedding.
3.4 Total all of the people in 3.2
3.5 If Spreadsheet Total < Maximum Head Count, congrats! Now go get their addresses
3.6 Else Time to Prune your list. Pruning consists of:
3.6a Move all people/couples that are of your generation AND that married while you were friends/family AND did not invite you to their wedding to a new list (List Z)
3.6b Delete all people/couples either bride OR groom had sex with.
3.6c Move all people/couples that you have not hung out with in 2 years OR find generally annoying/unpleasant to List Z. Exceptions available for family and college roommates that cleared both items 3.6a, 3.6b
3.6d Categorize guests into Family A, Family B, Friends A, Friends B, where A-class are people you feel you Must have as guests and B are people you Should or would Like to have present.
3.6e If Family A plus Friends A Equal to 80-100% of Maximum Head Count, Congrats! You are done. Now go get their addresses.
3.6f Else if Family A plus Family A greater than Maximum Head Count, discard Family B and Friend B
3.6f1 Move friends you have not hung out with in 1 year to List Z
3.6f2 Move relatives you haven't seen in 10 years to List Z
3.6f3 If A-list friends and family total is still greater than Maximum Head Count, consider a new venue.
3.6f4 If a new venue is out of the question, each bride and groom force ranks their guests by desirability.
3.6f4a Guest Overage equals Maximum Head Count minus Guest List Total
3.6f4b Groom Total is the number of groom's guests
3.6f4c Bride Total is the number of bride's guests
3.6f4d Groom Total divided by Guest List Total is Groom Share
3.6f4e Bride Total divided by Guest List Total is Bride Share
3.6f4f Bride and Groom multiply Guest Overage by their Respective Share
3.6f4g Bride and Groom delete their Respective Share of guests from the bottom of the force rank lists in 3.6f4
3.6f4h Congrats, you have hit your mark. Now go get their addresses!
3.6g Else we need to trim Family B and Friend B
3.6g1 Bride and Groom force rank their guests by desirability.
3.6g1a Guest Overage equals Maximum Head Count minus Guest List Total
3.6g1b Groom Total is the number of groom's guests
3.6g1c Bride Total is the number of bride's guests
3.6g1d Groom Total divided by Guest List Total is Groom Share
3.6g1e Bride Total divided by Guest List Total is Bride Share
3.6g1f Bride and Groom multiply Guest Overage by their Respective Share
3.6g1g Bride and Groom delete their Respective Share of guests from the bottom of the force rank lists in 3.6g1
3.6g1h Congrats, you have hit your mark. Now go get their addresses!
