1. Line of people at an amusement park

Overall, the line of people can best be represented by an array for the data structure. Some reasons are: 
A. We can represent the real world order of people in the order of the array elements.
B. We can mimic changes to the real world line accurately using array methods.
C. We are representing people with two pieces of data: a name and place in line that are adequately modeled by a string stored at a specific index.
D. We can assume that there are no ties in our line because it is a line for a ride where there is a 1:1 relationship between seats in the ride and line order.
