Amusement Park
1. Developers can manipulate the data structure with common array operations such as using the array[index] method to read and write/update data.
2. You can either use the #[] method to find an element by index, or array.index('string') to find the index of a given element.
3. This structure is useful for representing a list of unique items ordered along a single dimension where the order matters in storing and searching. Examples include lists of items ordered by priority (such as a to-do list or shopping list), step-by-step instructions (such as navigation, cooking or furniture assembly instructions), force-rankings (no ties allowed) (i.e. my ranked order of favorite things to eat, stars by size), and chronological ordering (ex. ordered list of names of Presidents of the United States).

Pixel
1. Developers can manipulate a pixel using the 2D array coordinates via the insert method of the screen object - Screen.insert(pixel, x, y). I would probably want to build some sort of linkage between the pixel object's x and y values and the x and y values used with this insert - they can differ and the pixel's x,y markers would be disregarded.
2. You would search for a pixel by the x,y coordinates, as Screeen.at(x,y) would return the pixel in a given location.
3. This data structure would be useful for any number of two dimensional grid-based representations where each x,y coordinate is a unique item, even if the uniqueness is simply the x,y coordinates themselves. Common table games such as chess, backgammon, and checkers could reasonably be represented by this data structure, with pieces instead of pixels. Similarly modified versions of this data structure could be used for mathematical graphs, floorplans and seating charts, performance information for business owners and stockbrokers with KPIs and day's price change instead of pixel colors, and even mapping and topography.
